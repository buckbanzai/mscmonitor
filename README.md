This is a small python application I've wrote to view incoming Midi Show Control in a easy way, received as a running log. This is very much a work in progress, but is basically functional in it's current state. 

Release 0.2 is available as a binary for MacOS 10.15.7 and newer (I think) in the releases pane on the right. It is not signed or notarized, so please use at your own risk.
